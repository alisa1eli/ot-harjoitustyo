# Tetris

### Purpose

Tetris a real-time game. To play it an user needs to sign up, which makes possible to save their results in order to continue the game later.

### Users

We have only one type of user, "a normal user" (a player).

A user:

    can sign up
    can sign in

When a user signed in, he/she

    can start a new game
    can delete their history of results ( in developing )
    can delete their account ( in developing )
