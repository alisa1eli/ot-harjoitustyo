# Manual

1. Download the file:
  [here](https://github.com/alisa1eli/ot-harjoitustyo/releases/tag/loppupalautus)
  The easiest way is to download jar file. But if you want the best user exprience, I do recommend to download scource code and     open it with NetBeans. This way the programm will be able to use its css file.
  
  2. When the program is opened, sign up. Remember your login! You will need to sign in lately.
  3. Sign in using your login.
  4. Start a game by pressing "New game!"
  5. Use LEFT and RIGHT to move blocks right and left. Press UP to rotate it. Press DOWN to make it move down a bit faster. Press SPACE to place it on the bottom.
  6. When the game is over, your can save your score. Or come back to your personal page without saving.
